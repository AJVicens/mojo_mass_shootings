Mother Jones mass shootings map
===========

This is a Google Spreadsheets-driven map made possible by the work of [Chris Essig](https://github.com/csessig86) which you can find [here](https://github.com/csessig86/tabletop_to_leaflet). I'm using it to create a readily-updateable map to accompany the magazine's [online guide to mass shootings in America.](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map/) 

His original repo allowed worked by using [Tabletop.js](http://builtbybalance.com/Tabletop/) with our [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BLs1cBe7RE62p2TFnLRwcHZ06viDJaRQhAcKrIKG6qI/edit#gid=0) to feed data to a [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) map template. Head over to his original repo to get full instructions for how to implement this process for your own needs.
