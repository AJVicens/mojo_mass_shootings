Mother Jones mass shootings map
===========

This is a Google Spreadsheets-driven map made possible by the work of [Chris Essig](https://github.com/csessig86) which you can find [here](https://github.com/csessig86/tabletop_to_leaflet). I'm using it to create a readily-updateable map to accompany the magazine's [online guide to mass shootings in America.](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map/) 

His original repo allowed worked by using [Tabletop.js](http://builtbybalance.com/Tabletop/) with our [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BLs1cBe7RE62p2TFnLRwcHZ06viDJaRQhAcKrIKG6qI/edit#gid=0) to feed data to a [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) map template. Head over to his original repo to get full instructions for how to implement this process for your own needs.

This project would not have been possible without the incredible talents of [Natasha Khan](https://twitter.com/khantasha), interactives & design editor at [PublicSource](https://www.publicsource.org/), [Alexandra Kanik](https://twitter.com/act_rational), data reporter interactive developer at [Louisville Public Media](http://louisvillepublicmedia.org/?_ga=2.248360135.1966944784.1525815272-1600937786.1525815272), and [Ben Breedlove](https://twitter.com/bdbreedlove), web developer at Mother Jones. A huge thank you to them for helping me get this to where it is now and also for helping me avoid several dumb mistakes I was set to make along the way.
